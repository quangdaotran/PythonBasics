### There are four built-in data structures in Python: list, tuple, dictionary and set.

### List (a type of sequence):
# items of a list are mutable
shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']
print('These items are:', end=' ')   # use "end" parameter in the call to "print" fuction to indicate that we want to end the output with a space instead of the usual line break
for item in shoplist:
    print(item, end=' ')

### Tuple (a type of sequence):
# parentheses used in tuples can be optional
# the name assigned to a tuple can be changed but not items inside it
singletuple = (2,)  # create a tuple containing one single item

### Dictionary:
# keys in a dictionary are immutable while values can be mutable or not; we should use simple objects for keys
# key-value pairs are separated by a colon and the pairs are separated themselves by commas and all this is enclosed in a pair of curly braces
# key will be used as indexing operator to get its associated value
addressbook = {
'Swaroop': 'swaroop@swaroopch.com',
'Larry': 'larry@wall.org',
'Matsumoto': 'matz@ruby-lang.org',
'Spammer': 'spammer@hotmail.com'
}
print("Swaroop's address is", addressbook['Swaroop'])
for name, address in addressbook.items():    # use "in" operator
    print('Contact {} at {}'.format(name, address))
