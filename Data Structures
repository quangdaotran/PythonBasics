### There are four built-in data structures in Python: list, tuple, dictionary and set.

### List:
# items of a list are mutable
shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']
print('These items are:', end=' ')   # use "end" parameter in the call to "print" fuction to indicate that we want to end the output with a space instead of the usual line break
for item in shoplist:
    print(item, end=' ')

### Tuple:
# parentheses used in tuples can be optional
# the name assigned to a tuple can be changed but not items inside it
singletuple = (2,)  # create a tuple containing one single item

### Dictionary:
# keys in a dictionary are immutable while values can be mutable or not; we should use simple objects for keys
