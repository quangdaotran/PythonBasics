### Writing new Module:
# the simplest way is to create a file with a .py extension that contains functions and variables.
# Another method is to write the modules in the native language in which the Python interpreter itself was written. For example, you can write modules in the C programming language, 
# and when compiled they can be used from your Python code when using the standard Python interpreter.

import sys   # use Python standard library module 'sys'
print('The command line arguments are:')
for i in sys.argv:
    print(i)
print('\n\nThe PYTHONPATH is', sys.path, '\n')
